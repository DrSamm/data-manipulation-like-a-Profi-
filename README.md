# Where do I need SQL in spite of using R professionally? DPLYR package
The first idea is to go through what I played with dplyr and open this discussion, why SQL when I can use dplyr. 
I got the impression at work, that mainly who comes from SQL world, are not aware of R package and their usage. I just got the inspiration of using nycflights13::flights. This dataset contains all 336776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013.
